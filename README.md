<details>
<summary>‚ö° Performance & Reliability</summary>

- Lightweight and resource-efficient
- Fast and responsive tab creation
- Stable COM-based implementation
- Reliable window state management
</details>

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/w4po/ExplorerTabUtility/releases) page or install it via `winget`:
```powershell
winget install w4po.ExplorerTabUtility
```
2. Run the application
3. Look for the tray icon and you're ready to go!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> The application runs in the system tray minimized by default.
> To configure it, double-click or right-click the tray icon.

<details>
<summary>üîß General Settings</summary>

- **WindowHook**: Enable/disable new windows being converted to tabs
- **ReuseTabs**: Enable/disable reusing existing tabs instead of creating new ones
- **Startup**: Configure automatic startup with Windows
</details>

<details>
<summary>‚å®Ô∏è Hotkey Profile Management</summary>

### Profile Options
- Create new profiles
- Import profiles from file
- Export profiles to file
- Enable/disable individual profiles

### Profile Settings
Each profile contains the following settings:

1. **Basic Settings**
   - Profile Name
   - Hotkey Combination (set by focusing the input field and pressing desired keys)
   - Scope: Global or Explorer-only (triggers only when File Explorer is focused)

2. **Action Settings**
   - Action Type:
     - `Open`: Open a new tab (optionally with specified path)
     - `Duplicate`: Duplicate current tab
     - `ReopenClosed`: Reopen last closed tab
     - `SetTargetWindow`: Set current Explorer window as the destination for new tabs
     - `ToggleWinHook`: Toggle window hook
     - `ToggleReuseTabs`: Toggle tab reuse
     - `ToggleVisibility`: Toggle form visibility
   - Path Field (for `Open` action)
     - Optional: Leave empty to open new tab
     - Supports multiple path formats (see Custom Path Navigation section)

3. **Advanced Settings**
   - Execution Delay: Slider to set delay before action execution
   - Key Handling: Toggle whether hotkeys are passed to other applications
   - Profile Deletion: Remove unwanted profiles

![Form](Assets/Form.png)

> [!TIP]
> Use the "Handled" toggle to prevent or allow hotkey propagation to other applications that might be listening for the same key combination.

> [!NOTE]
> The `SetTargetWindow` action lets you choose which Explorer window will receive new tabs. This is useful when you have multiple Explorer windows open or working on different virtual desktops and want to control where new tabs appear.

## üîß Technical Details

<details>
<summary>Implementation Overview</summary>

### Core Components

#### 1. üîå COM Integration
- Direct interaction with Windows Shell through native COM interfaces:
  - `Shell32`: Core shell functionality and file system operations
  - `SHDocVw`: Explorer window and tab management
  - Custom COM interface implementations for reliable shell interactions
- Efficient PIDL (Pointer to ID List) handling for file system operations
- Thread-safe COM object lifecycle management

#### 2. ü™ü Window Management
- Advanced window tracking and state management:
  - Concurrent collections for thread-safe window tracking
  - Efficient tab handle caching and validation
  - Smart window-to-tab conversion logic
- Support for special folder navigation (CLSID paths)

#### 3. ‚ö° Process & Event System
- Robust Explorer process monitoring:
  - Automatic recovery from Explorer crashes
  - Event-driven architecture for responsive UI
  - Efficient window event hooking
- Asynchronous operation handling:
  - STA (Single-threaded Apartment) task scheduler
  - Non-blocking COM operations
  - Proper synchronization with SemaphoreSlim

#### 4. üöÄ Performance Optimizations
- Smart caching mechanisms:
  - Window handle caching
  - Path comparison optimization
  - Tab state tracking
- Efficient resource management:
  - Proper COM object disposal
  - Memory-efficient collections
  - Minimal window recreation

### Key Technologies
- .NET 9 and .NET Framework 4.8.1
- Windows COM APIs
  - Shell32 and SHDocVw interfaces
  - Native P/Invoke
- Advanced threading with STA scheduler
- Concurrent collections for thread safety
</details>

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

> [!NOTE]
> While this utility is optimized for best performance, some operations might experience delays due to limitations in Windows File Explorer itself:
> - The File Explorer's tab interface lacks proper APIs for programmatic control
> - Some operations in File Explorer are inherently laggy, especially with multiple simultaneous window operations
> - Windows Shell doesn't expose all the necessary functionality for seamless tab management

Despite these Windows limitations, the utility implements the best possible solutions using available Windows APIs and COM interfaces.
