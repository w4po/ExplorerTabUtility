</details>

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

The utility can be uninstalled in several ways depending on how you installed it:

- **If you installed using the installer**: Use the standard Windows uninstaller
  - Go to "Settings > Apps > Installed apps"
  - Find "Explorer Tab Utility" and click "Uninstall"
  - Or use Control Panel > Programs and Features
  - Or run the uninstaller directly from the installation directory

- **If you installed via winget**:
  ```powershell
  winget uninstall w4po.ExplorerTabUtility
  ```

- **If you installed via Chocolatey**:
  ```powershell
  choco uninstall explorertabutility
  ```

- **If you used the portable version**: Simply delete the application folder
  - If you enabled the `Add to startup` option, make sure to disable it first before deletion

## Antivirus Detection

> [!WARNING]
> The utility might be flagged by antivirus software as suspicious. This is a **false positive** caused by our use of:
> - COM interactions (for File Explorer tab management)
> - Low-level keyboard & mouse hooks (for hotkey support)
>
> The tool is completely open source, and you can:
> - Review the source code in this repository
> - Build it yourself using Visual Studio
> - Verify its safety and functionality

### Adding to Windows Defender Exclusions

If Windows Defender is blocking the utility, you can add it to the exclusions list:

1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to `Virus & threat protection`
3. Click `Manage settings` under `Virus & threat protection settings`
4. Scroll down to `Exclusions` and click `Add or remove exclusions`
5. Click `Add an exclusion` and select `Folder`
6. Browse to the Explorer Tab Utility folder location

Alternatively, you can use PowerShell (Run as Administrator):
```powershell
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "PATH_TO_UTILITY_FOLDER"
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

> [!NOTE]
> While this utility is optimized for best performance, some operations might experience delays due to limitations in Windows File Explorer itself:
> - The File Explorer's tab interface lacks proper APIs for programmatic control
> - Some operations in File Explorer are inherently laggy, especially with multiple simultaneous window operations
> - Windows Shell doesn't expose all the necessary functionality for seamless tab management

Despite these Windows limitations, the utility implements the best possible solutions using available Windows APIs and COM interfaces.
